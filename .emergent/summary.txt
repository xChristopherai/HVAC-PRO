The previous AI engineer successfully brought the HVAC Assistant application from a basic template to an MVP with significant features. The work involved extensive full-stack development (FastAPI backend, React frontend), iterative UI redesigns (from Linear/Stripe to PayPal.com aesthetic, requiring significant CSS/component refactoring), and robust debugging, especially for persistent visual bugs and authentication issues. Key accomplishments include the implementation of AI Voice Scheduling (backend and partial frontend), a comprehensive backend for all major UI buttons, and a global fix for text visibility issues across the application. The work has been structured into distinct Phases for clarity, with Phases 2, 3, and 4 completed, and Phase 5 (Settings) currently underway, focusing on backend endpoint implementation and frontend component integration, with backend testing already passed. The engineer has demonstrated adaptability to changing UI requirements and persistence in resolving complex styling and functionality challenges.

The goal is to develop an AI-powered HVAC business management platform featuring an SMS receptionist, operations management, and owner analytics. Initially, the project shifted from a CORS bug fix to building the application from scratch.

Key functionalities include:
- **Phase 1 (MVP + Admin)**: AI SMS Receptionist, Business Dashboard, Settings, Multi-tenant Admin Portal, JWT Auth.
- **Phase 2 (Owner-Only)**: Owner Insights (Chart.js), Google Calendar (mock), In-App Messaging, Automated Customer Rating, Notifications, Template-Based SMS.
- **UI Redesign**: Transitioned from a Linear/Stripe aesthetic to a clean PayPal-style layout, emphasizing high contrast, readable text, a fixed left sidebar (260px), wide centered content (1200px), white rounded cards with subtle shadows, and a light PayPal-specific color palette.
- **AI Voice Scheduling**: Automate appointment booking via Twilio Voice Webhook () using a state machine, collecting customer details (name, address, issue, time), checking availability (), creating/finding customers (), and creating appointments (). Mock adapters are required if Twilio credentials are not provided. Frontend: Hide Schedule Appointment if  is true, show Created by AI Voice badge, and wire Add Customer button.
- **General**: Maintain existing functionality, re-enable authentication post-redesign, implement a  feature flag, ensure zero regressions, and tidy empty/error states.
- **Phase 2 (Dashboard)**: Render dashboard with mock KPIs (Customers, Jobs, Technicians, Appointments) including ▲/▼ deltas. Implement four Quick Actions (Add Customer, Schedule Job, Create Invoice, View Reports) with POST endpoints and toast notifications. Respect feature flags (, ).
- **Phase 3 (Customers & Appointments)**: Customers: Add modal (), Search + Filters (). Appointments: Calendar view (), tabs (scheduled/confirmed/in_progress/completed) via .
- **Phase 4 (Technicians & Messaging)**: Technicians: Add, Search, status tabs (available/busy/off_duty/unavailable). Messaging: Search + tabs (all/active/converted/pending). New Message behind a flag (default hidden).
- **Phase 5 (Settings)**: All sections (Business, AI, SMS, Calendar, Notifications, Billing, Service Areas, Integrations) should save data via a unified  endpoint. Billing allows management, and Integrations store credentials. Payments list should include PayPal/Venmo/Apple Pay (store creds only). Persistence upon refresh and test event success required.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate backend and frontend directories.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : The core FastAPI application. It has been extensively updated to support over 150 API endpoints, manage CORS, handle authentication (temporarily disabled for dashboards, then re-enabled), and expose root-level endpoints. Recent updates include:
    *   Support for filtering appointments by .
    *   New endpoints for AI Voice Scheduling (, ).
    *   Backend endpoints for Quick Actions (, , , ).
    *   Backend endpoints for Customers search ().
    *   Backend endpoints for Appointments calendar view and filtering (, ).
    *   Backend endpoints for Technicians (, ).
    *   Backend endpoints for Messaging (, ).
    *   Unified settings update endpoint () and individual settings endpoints for Calendar, Notifications, Billing, Service Areas, and Integrations.
-   : Defines MongoDB data models. Created from scratch, it now includes  enum,  and  fields in  model, and an  model. Recent edits also included import fixes.
-   : Contains various mock services and utility functions. Recent changes include adding missing functions like  and others used by  for AI Voice Scheduling.
-   : The main React application and routing hub. It has been fully rewritten multiple times for feature sets, authentication, and UI redesigns. It now incorporates the  feature flag and passes  to relevant components.
-   : Global and component-level styles. Redesigned multiple times for different UI aesthetics (Linear/Stripe, PayPal). It includes CSS variables for the design system and has undergone various fixes for background colors and styling.
-   : Critical for global styling. Recently modified to apply comprehensive text styling rules, using  (text-gray-800) for primary and  (text-gray-600) for secondary text, resolving widespread text visibility issues.
-   : The owner-only analytics dashboard. Redesigned for PayPal aesthetic, it now includes functional KPIs with deltas and four Quick Actions buttons with mock success toasts.
-   : The comprehensive settings panel. Initially created and redesigned for PayPal, it has been completely rewritten to include functional sections for Business, AI Assistant, SMS Settings, Calendar, Notifications, Billing, Service Areas, and Integrations, all connected to backend persistence via . It also underwent multiple rounds of text color fixes.
-   : Customers list. Enhanced with Add Customer button functionality (opening a form and POSTing to ), search, and filter capabilities.
-   : Appointments list. Enhanced with a calendar view, status tabs (scheduled/confirmed/in_progress/completed), and a toggle between list and calendar views. The Schedule Appointment button is now conditionally hidden based on .
-   : Technicians list. Enhanced with add functionality, search, and status tabs (available/busy/off_duty/unavailable).
-   : In-app messaging component. Enhanced with search functionality, status tabs (all/active/converted/pending), and a New Message feature hidden behind a flag.
-   : Frontend environment variables.  and  were added/configured.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Production Deployment Fix**: The issue of the application not working on the production URL due to platform-level routing issues remains unresolved.
- **Re-enable Full Authentication**: Authentication is temporarily disabled for dashboard endpoints and needs to be re-enabled fully.
- **Complete Phase 3 Roadmap**: This includes Stripe/PayPal payments, QuickBooks/Xero integration, advanced calendar features, enhanced notifications, and mobile optimization. (Note: The term Phase 3 roadmap here refers to the user's initial large-scale vision, not the completed Phase 3 of the current development trajectory.)
- **Twilio Integration**: Full integration with real Twilio credentials (instead of mock adapters).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on **PHASE 5 — Settings**. This phase involved comprehensively updating all settings tabs (Business, AI, SMS, Calendar, Notifications, Billing, Service Areas, Integrations) to persist data via a unified backend endpoint.

Specifically, the engineer has:
1.  **Backend Implementation**:
    *   Examined existing settings endpoints in .
    *   Created a new unified  endpoint in  to handle all general settings updates.
    *   Restarted the backend to load the new endpoint.
    *   Successfully passed backend API tests for all Phase 5 settings endpoints with a 100% success rate, confirming data saving and retrieval for Calendar, Notifications, and Billing.
2.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    *   Completely rewrote the  file to integrate full Phase 5 functionality for all sections, including forms, logic for saving data, and conditional rendering.
    *   Restarted the frontend to apply these changes.

The current state is that the backend for Phase 5 settings is fully functional and tested, and the frontend components have been implemented and restarted. The next immediate step is to verify the frontend changes visually through screenshots and complete the acceptance criteria for Phase 5 as defined by the user.
